# Lazy-evaluation-and-caching
This mini-project features a Java class where are highlighted the benefits behind using lazy evaluation, which turns a blind eye on the review of an expression until it is necessary. Caching is a process for storing regularly used information in memory so it can be quickly accessed instead of being generated by the program every time it is required.
